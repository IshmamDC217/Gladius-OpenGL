# 2D Gladius Rendering with Legacy OpenGL

This repository contains the code and resources necessary for rendering a simplified 2D representation of a Roman Gladius using legacy OpenGL functions and Qt Creator for the graphical user interface. The Gladius, known for its prominence in the hands of Roman foot soldiers, is rendered here in a two-dimensional profile, showcasing the basic shape and form of this iconic weapon.
 
## Overview

The Roman Gladius is a short sword with a characteristic leaf-shaped blade that served as the primary sidearm of Roman legionaries. Historically, its design is perfect for close combat and was a symbol of Roman martial prowess. This project is a digital homage to the Gladius, designed to provide a fundamental example of how such historical items can be represented in computer graphics.

The rendering process uses the deprecated, immediate mode OpenGL API (also known as "old school" OpenGL) for educational purposes. This API allows for a straightforward understanding of how geometric shapes are created and manipulated in computer graphics.

## Features

- **2D Profile Rendering**: A clear and simplified two-dimensional profile of a Roman Gladius.
- **Interactive Interface**: Utilization of Qt Creator allows for an interactive experience where users can manipulate the view of the Gladius.
- **Custom OpenGL Widget**: A dedicated widget for OpenGL rendering, which can be further extended for more complex projects.
- **Material and Lighting**: Basic material properties and lighting effects to simulate metal and wood textures.
- **Legacy OpenGL**: The project serves as a learning tool for legacy OpenGL functions.

## Dependencies

- **Qt Framework**: Ensure you have the latest version of the Qt framework installed.
- **Qt Creator IDE**: This project is developed using the Qt Creator IDE, making use of its user interface design and coding capabilities.
- **OpenGL**: The system must support OpenGL 2.1 or earlier for compatibility with legacy OpenGL functions.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. **Install Qt Creator**: If not already installed, download and install Qt Creator from [Qt's official website](https://www.qt.io/download).
3. **Open the Project**: Launch Qt Creator and open the provided project file.
4. **Compile and Run**: Build the project and run the application.

## Usage

Upon running the application, you will see a window displaying the Gladius. The interface includes sliders that allow you to adjust various visual aspects such as lighting and rotation. Use these sliders to view the Gladius from different angles and under different lighting conditions.

## Acknowledgments

- **Roman Military History**: The inspiration behind this project is drawn from the rich military history of the Roman Empire.
- **OpenGL Community**: A thank you to the online community for providing extensive resources on legacy OpenGL.
- **Qt Documentation**: For comprehensive guides and references that support application development using Qt Creator.
